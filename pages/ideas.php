<h3>Exploration-based MMO</h3>
<ul>
    <li><h4>Crafting like GW2</h4>
    <li><h4>Bosses-only combat</h4>
        <p>Somewhat like Shadow of the Colossus. Pure exploration would be boring for most people,
        but adding common mobs would make it just like any other MMO. And, imagine climbing a 
        huge boss with multiple people.
    <li><h4>Movement/acrobatics like Prince of Persia</h4>
    <li>Players can help each other get to shortcuts like Elika throwing the Prince (shortcuts only, don't force players to cooperate; it has to come naturally like in GW2)
</ul>
