### Name
My real name is Ruben Verdoes.

The name "horsedrowner" is inspired from a certain unit in the game *Age of Mythology*, which had
randomized names. The last name consisted of two halves, and "Horsedrowner" is one of the many
[possibilities][hersir_names].

Writing about yourself is awkward.
