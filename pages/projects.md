Imdex
=====

A screenshot/image index page that I use in conjunction with Superscrot. This 
was originally made in PHP with [Bootstrap] and also featured a simple login 
system backed by an SQLite "database". 

After rewriting my own site in Ruby, I also started rewriting this in Ruby 
using [Semantic UI] and GitHub login for authentication. Look for the 
`master-ruby` branch.

[Latest release](http://s.horsedrowner.net)
